## How to Use the Collection

### Setting Environment variables

The collection is organized into folders and requests to assist you in performing various tasks related to Kong Konnect, including managing entities, configuring plugins, and more. Each request is pre-configured with appropriate headers and parameters.

You can customize these requests to fit your specific use case. Be sure to provide your own API credentials, endpoints, and other configuration parameters where necessary in the environment section. To set up the environment section. Do the following:

1. Click on the Environment section in Insomnia (top left gear icon highlighted)

![Environment](./images/environment.png)

2. Create a new Private environment

3. Copy the json in the `Environment Template` section and paste into the private environment
4. The two most important settings to configure would be the `proxy` endpoint as this is the endpoint we will use to test Kong. In my example its `http://localhost:8000` as this is the default http endpoint for the proxy. This could be the loadbalancer address of the proxy also. The other is `konnect_access_token`, this is the Personal access token or System Access token which should be obtained from Konnect.
